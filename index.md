I am a Ph.D. student in the group of [James Whitfield](https://physics.dartmouth.edu/people/james-daniel-whitfield) in the Physics and Astronomy department at Dartmouth College. 

My reearch focus is in quantum information theory. Specifically I am interested in how by studying fermionic systems we can better understand the border between classical and quantum complexity.
