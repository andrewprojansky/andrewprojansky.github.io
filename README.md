# Overview

Hello! I'm Andrew. I'm current a Ph.D. candidate under advisor James Whitfield, working at Dartmouth College in the department of Physics and Astronomy. I am interested in a wide range of topics in quantum information theory, though my specific interest is in better understanding the border between classical and quantum computing. 

## The border of classical and quantum computing

It's very important for us to remember that just because we may have access to quantum computers someday, it does not mean every computational tasks will be run on a quantum device. Though we have had some recent breakthroughs in how usable our quantum devices are, both in the near and long term quantum devices will not be in everyones home, but will be maintained in controlled labs. To run jobs on these devices will be costly; as we get closer to usable quantum computers, we need promises that the tasks we are runnning on these devices are indeed worth our time and money. We should not waste quantum resources on tasks we can do with classical computers. 

It is thus more important than ever that we have an understanding of the border between classical and quantum. How do we guarentee a task we hope to do really does need a quantum computer? How can we leverage what we know about classical simulating quantum circuits to find the most efficient hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for our task? By pushing the boundary and proving when quantum circuits are simulable allows us to make sure with certainty that some job we give a quantum computer really needs the quantum computer, and that we are using these delicate devices most efficiently. 

## Fermions and free fermions

Fermions are fundamental atomic consistuents; indistinguishable particles that govern how molecules interact. Due to their indistinguishability, they inherit a number of interesting mathematical and physical properties, such as the well known Pauli exclusion principle. Though within my research group we study fermions in the context of quantum chemistry, I also use them as a tool to understand the classical and quantum divide. Free fermions are a subclass of fermionic models which are easy to understand and model, and whose time dynamics are encapsulted by a set of simulable circuits with interesting properties. I specifically study how free fermion circuits and circuits close to free fermion can be better understood, so that we better understand what is and is not classically simulable. 


### Fun!
